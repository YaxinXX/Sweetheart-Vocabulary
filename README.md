Welcome to **Sweetheart Vocabulary**, a beautifully minimalistic and fully personalized vocabulary notebook web app — crafted for serious language learners who want control, relevance, and long-term memory.

## ✨ Why I Built This

While reading academic papers or exploring new topics, I often come across unfamiliar yet important words. Existing vocabulary tools felt too generic — filled with irrelevant words or fixed content I don’t need.  
So I created **Sweetheart Vocabulary** for:

- Curating a personal, **highly relevant vocabulary list**
- Avoiding overload from pre-filled word databases
- Encouraging **active recall** and customized learning

It’s like a living “New vocabulary notebook” tailored entirely to your goals.
